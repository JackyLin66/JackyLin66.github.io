My name is Shijie Lin, a dedicated Data Science student at Northeastern University with a strong background in both real estate and technology. Currently, I am working as a Real Estate Sales Agent at Space Realty in Boston, where I have successfully generated over $100,000 in revenue within the first six months through effective client negotiations and strategic marketing. My experience also includes working as a Sales Associate at an Apple Authorized Retailer and an intern at Ping An Securities in China, where I developed essential skills in client relations, sales strategies, and market analysis.&lt;/p&gt;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;p&gt;Beyond my professional experience, I have a passion for volunteering and founded the Support Education (SE) initiative in Sichuan, China. This project focuses on increasing access to educational resources in underserved areas, and it has significantly expanded its reach through partnerships and community engagement. In my free time, I enjoy hiking, playing guitar, and exploring sports like soccer and billiards.&lt;/p&gt;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;img src="your-image.jpg" alt="A relevant image about me" width="300"&gt;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;/section&gt;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;/main&gt;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;footer&gt;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;p&gt;Contact: &lt;a href="mailto:your-email@example.com"&gt;your-email@example.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;/footer&gt;<br>&lt;/body&gt;<br>&lt;/html&gt;<br></p></body></html>
