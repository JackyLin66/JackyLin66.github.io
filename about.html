My experience spans multiple fields, including real estate and retail sales. At Space Realty, I consistently exceed sales targets, develop client relationships, and use data analysis to provide strategic advice on market conditions. My previous roles also include a sales associate position at an Apple Authorized Retailer and a lobby manager intern at a hotel in China, each experience contributing to my customer service and analytical skills.&lt;/p&gt;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;p&gt;In addition to my work, I am the founder of Support Education (SE) in Sichuan, China, where I manage campaigns and community events to support education in underserved areas. This initiative has increased its fundraising by 40% and expanded its volunteer base by 50%, making a meaningful impact on the community. I am passionate about using my skills to make a positive difference in the world.&lt;/p&gt;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;ul&gt;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;li&gt;Hiking and exploring nature&lt;/li&gt;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;li&gt;Playing guitar and learning new musical pieces&lt;/li&gt;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;li&gt;Sports, especially soccer and billiards&lt;/li&gt;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;/ul&gt;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;img src="another-image.jpg" alt="Image about my passion" width="300"&gt;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;/section&gt;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;/main&gt;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;footer&gt;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;p&gt;Contact: &lt;a href="mailto:your-email@example.com"&gt;your-email@example.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;/footer&gt;<br>&lt;/body&gt;<br>&lt;/html&gt;<br></p></body></html>
